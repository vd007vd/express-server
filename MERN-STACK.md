# ** MERN-STACK**

** MERN-STACK:** MERN-STACK is a stack which is full stack developement of JavaScript. MERN stands for MondoDB, Express, React, and Node.

1.  ### **MondoDB:**

        MondoDB is a NoSQL database where each record is a document comprising of key-value pairs that are similar to JSON(JavaScript Object Notation) objects. MondoDB comes with teh Mongo shell which provides a JavaScript interface through which the users can interact with the database and perform all the actions with it.

    - Data can be stored in multiple devices
    - Simple to setup

2.  ### **Express:**

        Express is a Node.js framework. Express has pre-installed Node modules, Express makes it simpler and easier to write the back-end code and makes the whole process faster.

    **Advantage of Express:**

    - Asynchronous and Single-Threaded
    - Effecient
    - Fast & Scalable
    - Biggest community
    - Code resuablity, built-in router, robust API

3.  ### **React:**

        React is used for the developement of SPA *(Single Page Application)* and mobile applications because of its ability to handle rapidly changing data. React allows users to code in JavaScript and create UI components. It uses JSX format.

        Node is JavaScript runtime environment which allows us to execute code directly on the server. NPM(Node package Manager) helps us in managing the correct packets for easy and smooth uses of pacakages.

    **Advantages of Node:**

    - Open Source JS runtime environment
    - Follows single threaded model
    - Fast
    - High Performance
