# **12 FACTOR APP STACK**

The Twelve-Factor App methodology is a methodology for building software-as-a-service applications. These best practices are designed to enable applications to be built with portability and resilience when deployed to the web.

There are 12 methodologies:

1. **Codebase:**
   There should be exactly one codebase for a deployed service with the codebase being used for many deployments.

2. **Dependencies:**
   All dependencies should be declared, with no implicit reliance on system tools or libraries.

3. **Config:**
   Configuration that varies between deployments should be stored in the environment.

4. **Backing services:**
   All backing services are treated as attached resources and attached and detached by the execution environment.

5. **Build, release, run:**
   The delivery pipeline should strictly consist of build, release, run.

6. **Processes:**
   Applications should be deployed as one or more stateless processes with persisted data stored on a backing service.

7. **Port binding:**
   Self-contained services should make themselves available to other services by specified ports.

8. **Concurrency:**
   Concurrency is advocated by scaling individual processes.

9. **Disposability:**
   Fast startup and shutdown are advocated for a more robust and resilient system.

10. **Dev/Prod parity:**
    All environments should be as similar as possible.

11. **Logs:**
    Applications should produce logs as event streams and leave the execution environment to aggregate.

12. **Admin Processes:**
    Any needed admin tasks should be kept in source control and packaged with the application.
